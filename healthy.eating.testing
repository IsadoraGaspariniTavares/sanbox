        <h1>Healthy Eating</h1>
        <p>Healthy eating means providing all the fundamental nutrients for the functioning of our body, such as carbohydrates, lipids, protein, mineral salts, and vitamins</p>
        <p> The key to having a healthy diet is balance. We cannot exclude any of the nutrients from our diet, but we must be aware of the amount of everthing that we ingest. There is no way of compensating the lack of one nutrient by ingesting another one in larger quantities.</p>
